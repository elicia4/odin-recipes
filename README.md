# Recipes

This is a simple website written in HTML only.

It contains recipes of some of the foods I like.

[You can take a look at it.](https://elicia4.github.io/odin-recipes/)

The goal of creating this project is to practice writing simple HTML code,
namely:

- creating an HTML boilerplate;
- using headers;
- using paragraphs;
- using links;
- using lists;
- using images;
- using relatives and absolute links;
- utilizing `git`;
- publishing this website on GitHub.
